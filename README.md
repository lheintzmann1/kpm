## About

A fast, declarative, and extensible package manager for Kotlin. Inspired by NPM, Yarn, and Nix, KPM simplifies dependency management and reproducible builds in Kotlin projects.

## Features

The following commands have been implemented:
- `init`: Initialize a new KPM project using the base template.
- `install`: Apply the `kpm.json` file to the current project, installing dependencies and generating a `kpm-lock.json` file.
- `version`: Display the current version of KPM, Java, and Kotlin.
- `help`: Show help information for KPM commands.
